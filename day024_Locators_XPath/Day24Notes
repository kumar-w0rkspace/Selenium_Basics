Day24 - Xpath
=============

>Single and multiple attribute xpaths
>and / or operator xpaths
>xpath with text method
>xpath with contains function
>xpath with starts-with function
>chained xpaths

Xpath-->
    xpath works on xml(extensible markup language)
    xpath is an address of the element
    works based on DOM(Document Object Model- created when browsing pages on runtime)
    if dom is not loaded correctly even though the xpath is correct, the code will throw an error

2 types - 
>Absolute(full) xPath (No attributes, only tag names)
>Relative(Partial) xPath (Usage of attributes)

    Absolute eg (we dont use attributes)- /html/body/div[6]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/a/img
    (start from root HTML node)

    Relative eg (we use [attributes])- //input[@id='small-searchterms']
    (dont start from root node, and is mainly used for dynamically changing pages)

Difference between both
    abs xpath with follow the full path to the element, but rel xpath jumps to the element based on attribute
    abs xpath starts with /, but rel xpath starts with //
    abs xpath dont use attributes, but rel xpath does

Relative xPath
--------------

//tagname[@attribute='value']
//*[@attribute='value']

>>single attribute xpath for an element
    syntax - "//*[@class='nav-link']")).click();

>>multiple attribute xpath for an element
    syntax - "//*[@name='search'][@placeholder='Search']")).sendKeys("Dang");
    (multile attribute make your xpath more stronger)

>>and / or operators
    and syntax - //*[@name='search' and @placeholder='Search']
    or syntax - //*[@name='search' or @placeholder='Search']


>>inner text method
    text() [text can be replaced with .]
    //tag[text()='Random Text'] -- custom xpath where attribute is shifted to text method

    <a href="https://xyz.com"> Click ME </a>
    Click ME is linked text and inner text

    <div>Welcome</div>
    Welcome is not a linked text, but is an inner text


>>contains()
    Partial value of the attribute
    //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Sea')] --- will search for the elements contains letters Sea

>>start with()
    //input[starts-with(@name, 'Bo')]
    use wheneever we want to locate dynamic webelements
    handling dynamic attributes eg - stopwatch in webpage that use same button as start and stop
 
Cant generate these xpath. have to generate manually
    //*[@id='start' or @id ='stop']
    //*[contains(@id,'st')]
    //*[starts-with(@id, 'st')]
    
eg 2
name = xyz001, xyz002, xyz003, xyz004
    //*[contains(@name,'xyz')]
    //*[starts-with(@name,'xyz')]
    //*[contains(@name, '00')]
eg3
name= 101xyz, 201xyz, 301xyz..
    //[contains(@name,'xyz')]
    //[starts-with(name,'xyz']


Chained Xpath (combination of rel and abs xPath)   
    //tag[@id='logo']/a/img
    here the target is img, but we cant find any attributes for it, so we go levels up to find an element with attribute and then give path to img

>>> Difference between CSS selector and xPath
    >Css can only do top to down approach
    >xPath is multidirectional (xPath Axes)
