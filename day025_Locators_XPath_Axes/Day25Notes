Day25 - Xpath Axes
==================

XPath axes
----------
>Using xpath axes we can navigate the page from top to bottom or bottom to top and find any element on webpage even though we have no attribute mentioned (using neighbour elements)

>We can navigate in all directions in DOM using xpath axes (multidirection)
>In DOM there is only one parent for one element

Different type of xPath axes -
    The way is by using an element as a node and navigate through the node using some relations

Xpath Axes Relations

                    Ancestor::

                            parent::

    preceeding-siblings::   selfNode   following-siblings::

                            child::

                          descendant::

self, parent, child, ancestor, descendant, following, preceding, following-sibling, preceeding-sibling

Locating Parent element->
    RelxPath/parent::tagname
    RelxPath/parent::::*
    RelxPath/parent::::..   (not used always)


Locating Child element->
    RelxPath/child::tagname
    RelxPath/tagname


In practice / is used instead of child:: from the known xpath

Locating Grandchildren element->
    RelxPath/child/tagname
    RelxPath/*/tagname


Locating Ancestor->
    RelxPath/ancestor::tagname
    RelxPath/ancestor::*


Locating Descandant->
    RelxPath/descendant::tagname
    RelxPath//tagname
    RelxPath//tagname[2]


We can use // instead of descendant:: keyword
    it ignores all the tags between root element and target element
    if there are two tagname, pass the index number like tagname[1]

Locating Following
    RelxPath/following::tagname
    RelxPath/following::*
    RelxPath/following::tagname[branch no.]
    RelxPath/following::tagname[first()] - to capture the first element on the siblings tree
    RelxPath/following::tagname[last()] - to capture the last element on the siblings tree


Locating Preceeding
    RelxPath/preceeding::tagname
    RelxPath/preceeding::*
    RelxPath/preceeding::tagname[branch no.]
    RelxPath/preceeding::tagname[first()] - to capture the first element on the siblings tree
    RelxPath/preceeding::tagname[last()] - to capture the last element on the siblings tree

Following/preceeding VS following-sibling/ preceeding-sibling
-------------------------------------------------------------
>>following/preceeding elements may or maynot be siblings<<
>>following-sibling/preceeding-sibling are strictly siblings<<

Following-sibling->
    RelxPath/following-sibling::tagname
    RelxPath/following-sibling::*
    RelxPath/following-sibling::*[branch no.]


Preceeding-sibling->
    RelxPath/preceeding-sibling::tagname
    RelxPath/preceeding-sibling::*
    RelxPath/preceeding-sibling::*[branch no.]


Chained xpath axes
------------------
    xpath1|xpath2...|xpathn
    eg. //tagname[@attribute='value']//tagname[@attribute='value']//tagname

-END-
