Basic WebDriver methods - 
    get methods              web page/s (driver method)
    conditional methods      return boolean values (element methods)
    browser methods          close,quit (driver method)
    wait methods             page wait till find element (driver method)
    navigational methods     driver navigation (driver method)
 

web element - an element present on webpage (inputbox, checkbox, radio button etc.)


WebDriver get methods
---------------------
    get(url) - opens the url on the browser
    getTitle() - returns the title of the page
    getCurrentUrl() - returns the URL of the page
    getPageSoruce() - returns the source code of the page
    getWindowHandle() - returns ID of the single browser window (Dynamic each time we open a window)
    getWindowHandles() - returns ID's of mutliple web browser (Dynamic each time we open a window)

>>for getWindowHandles() the return type is Set<String>, as Set<String> will not let duplicates<<
    Set<String> windowsID=driver.getWindowHandles();

whenever we open another link through automation, the new tab will be focused but the driver will be still on old tab.
we have to switch to new tab through code

we can use getwindowhandle/s +  SWITCHING COMMANDS(later eps) to navigate through multiple tabs

WebDriver conditional methods (access these commands through WebElement (Mainly used for validation tasks))
-----------------------------
    isDisplayed()- anything that can be located
    isEnabled() - anything but its use is for input data boxes(interactable, non static, operational)
    isSelected() - to check if element is selected or not (radio, checkbox, dropdown etc)


WebDriver browser methods 
-------------------------
    driver.close(); - closes the current window(whereever the driver is focused)
    driver.quit() - closes the whole browser

-END-
