Css (Cascading Style Sheet) Graphical Selector, Customisable selector

In some webpages single attributes might not be there. so we gotta go with customisable 

4 combinations - (no need to mention tag in code)
    tag id               --- tag#id
    tag class            --- tag.class
    tag attributes       --- tag[attribute = "value"]
    tag class atrributes --- tag.classname[attribute = "value"] (differentiate web elements of same branch)

>tag.class might have multiple elements and to precision pick an element, we use attribute also along with tag and class
(tag and class for group of element, tag class attri for one single speficic element)

>>Before using it on code, double check if the name is correct by searching it on the browser dev tools<<

# = id
. = class
[] = attributes

Assignment- opencart > use css locators and identify some elements
