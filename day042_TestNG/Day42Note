Day42 TestNG (Integration)
==========================
TestNG -Test New Generation
--------------------------
It is a unit testing tool which testers can use it for building framework
TestNG is only for Java (Alternate and popular - JUnit)

We can use TestNG for
Writing tc
Organizing tc
Executing tc
Generating report
Parallel testing and more..

>>If there are 10 tc that needs to be executed in priority, TestNG is a suite used to order or streamline the tests<<
Advantages
----------
	> Test cases and Test suites
	> Grouping of Test cases
	> Prioritizing
	> Parameterization (Eg: passing browser parameter at runtime)
	> Parallel testing
	> Reports
	
Configuration
-------------
From Eclipse marketplace, download TestNG and install it (Eclipse has TestNG but not the project)
Then add dependency from Mvn.repo to our project pom.xml file
	
Writing test cases in TestNG style
----------------------------------
TestNG test cases don't have main method.
Instead we use annotation @Test to run the script
	
We need to understand the Test cases and create methods for it accordingly
After creating method, we need to give annotation @ test and import org.testng.annotations.Test package
Then we can run the class by running it as TestNG Test.

There will be two outputs
	1. Console report
	2. TestNG report
Notes
	1> TestNG execute test methods based on alphabetical order
	2> @Test(priority=intNum) controls the order of execution
	3> Once the priority is provided to test methods, then order of methods in script is not considered
	4> Priorities can be random integer numbers (Doesn't have to be consecutive)
	5> If no priority is given, the default value is zero
	6> If the same priority values are given, then the methods are executed in alphabetical order
	7> Negative values are also allowed in priority (priority just have to be integer)
	8> TestNG executes test method only if they are having @Test annotation

We can create testNG class instead of basic java class
If we have one single test case class, we can run as TestNG and execute
But if we have multiple test case class, and we need to execute all of them, we can use TestNG.xml file to run all at once

	Once we use testng.xml file, we can see the extended testng report.
	Right click the class/classes we need to convert to testng and click convert to TestNG.
	Give path where we need the xml file to be placed
	There will be an error on the xml file, just click and download for the error.

Once executed, there will be a new folder named test-output folder for the reports in project level
(refresh every time after an execution)
Important among them are
	1> emailable report
	2> index report

We can manually make the xml file to add multiple class and add more details to it
eg :
	> parallel testing, grouping, parameterization etc

Advantage of xml
	execution of group of testcases
	report availability(after execution)
	
Sample xml format
-----------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">

<suite name="myTestSuite">
	<test name="firstTest">
		<classes>
			<class name="day042_TestNG.AB_OrangeHRM"></class>
			<class name="day042_TestNG.AA_BareBasics"></class>
		</classes>
	</test>
</suite>
