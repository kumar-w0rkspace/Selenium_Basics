Day36 MouseSliders and KeyBoard Actions
==================================

Sliders
-------
	> Sliders are commonly seen in eCommerce apps (Price range etc)
	> Sliders are a lot like drag and drop, but the difference is there is no drop point
	> If we can find the element to slide, then we can set the distance by using Point class in selenium
	
Note - We find the current position of the element using element.getLocation() method
	   which returns the current position of element in Point class object type (Selenium class)
	   element.getLocation().getX() -> returns the x axis only
	   element.getLocation().getY() -> returns the y axis only

After getting the location of the slider element, we need to see which axis the slider has to be moved
We need to use the mouse actions class to perform the movement also
eg:
	WebElement minSlider = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//span[1]"));
	Actions act = new Actions(driver);
	syso(minSlider.getLocation());
	act.dragAndDropBy(minSlider, 100, 250).perform();

Here the minSlider is the slider button we need to move.
We perform the movement by dragAndDropBy() method which takes a webelement, x axis and y axis as parameters

Note >> There will always be some minor tolerance(+-5) in the axis location, but it will be close to required parameter.<<
	The minimum and maximum sliders will have to go positive or negative values to adjust to the webpage
	eg: min slider --> +100 x and same y
		max slider --> -100 x and same y
